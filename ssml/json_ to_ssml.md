# json to Speech Synthesis Markup Language

This basic script converts a json file with a hypothetical e-mail list to Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), for a
hands-free situation where a virtual assistant is needed to read your email inbox. 

Documentation for SSML can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup-voice
